csv2coll
========

python script that converts an excel-exported .csv file into a .txt file readable by max/msp's coll object


USAGE:
===========
Replace "INPUT FILE NAME.csv", "OUTPUT FILE NAME.txt", and "BLANK REPLACE CHARACTER" with your desired filenames/string. Run, reference the .txt output file in a coll object in max/msp (make sure the .txt is in your max/msp project directory), and you're good to go!
